                <h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
                <p>
                    Breast cancer begins when cells in the breast tissue mutate and start to grow uncontrollably. These abnormal cells can form a tumor, which may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). If left untreated, malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body.
                </p>
                
                <h1>Risk Factors and Causes</h1>
                <p>
                    Gender: Women are at a significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to men.<br><br>

                    Age: The risk of breast cancer increases with age, with the majority of cases occurring in women over the age of 50.<br><br>
                    
                    Family History and Genetics: Individuals with a family history of breast cancer, particularly in close relatives like mother, sister, or daughter, are at higher risk. Mutations in genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2 also increase susceptibility.<br><br>
                    
                    Hormonal Factors: Prolonged exposure to estrogen, due to early menstruation, late menopause, or hormone replacement therapy, can increase the risk.<br><br>
                </p>
                
                <h1>Precautions and Early Detection</h1>
                <p> Regular Self-Examinations: Perform monthly breast self-exams to become familiar with the normal texture and appearance of your breasts. Report any changes to your healthcare provider.<br><br>

                    Clinical Breast Examinations: Schedule regular clinical breast examinations with a healthcare professional, especially as you age.<br><br>
                    
                    Mammograms: Follow recommended screening guidelines for mammograms, which are essential for detecting breast cancer in its early stages.<br><br>
                    
                    Healthy Lifestyle Choices: Adopt a balanced diet, engage in regular physical activity, limit alcohol consumption, and avoid smoking to reduce overall cancer risks.<br><br>
